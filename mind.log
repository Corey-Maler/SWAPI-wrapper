Hi! I'm Konstantin Zarvansky

This is initial commit and I will use this file to log most of my minds while developing solution

I will start from searching some webpack-typescript-lib boilerplate.

https://github.com/lomboboo/webpack-typescript-boilerplate this one looks good and enought modern. Use it.

"Error: Cannot find module 'hard-source-webpack-plugin'" -- not so good boilerplate :) Let's fix it.

Problem caused by windows: package can't be installed on this OS. Okay, I'll try to use bash-in-windows (I hate npm modules that requires compilation. There are always problems with them).

"Module build failed: Error: Node Sass does not yet support your current environment: Linux 64-bit with Unsupported runtime (59)" Did I mention that I hate native modules? node-sass probably most-annoying from them.

Blue Screen Of Death. I'm lucky today.

Okay, let's just clean src and boilerpate and finally start coding.
